# UpPlan
A 3D map of Faculty of Computer Science & Information Technology in University Putra Malaysia. The map uses Augmented Reality technology which was developed using Unity, Vuforia and Blender.

## MAIN MENU

<img src="images/main_menu.png" alt="Main Menu" width="300" height="500"/>

When you start up the app , you will be directed to the Main Menu. Here you can choose from a list of location to explore. There are 6 options provided but only one works for now and that is the “FSKTM” option. Click on “FSKTM” option to proceed.

## LOCATION MENU

Once you choose a location, you will see a pop-up which is a Destination Menu. Here you can select:
• Open Map to proceed to the 3D map.
• Explore Locations to search for a specific location
• Back to return to Main Menu

## SPECIFIC LOCATION MENU

If you selected Explore Locations in the Location Menu you will see a list of locations and that will be the Specific Location Menu. Selecting one of these locations will not only show you the 3D map but also the navigations to the selected specific location.

## IMAGE TARGET

If you have selected “Open Map” or selected a specific location, your phone camera should start up (Please allow camera access, if you are prompted to).The 3D map should appear on the camera. However, it requires an image target to do so. Please use our UpPlan image target which is shown on Figure 4.1 below. Place the image target under the phone camera like in Figure 4.2. The 3D map will then appear on top of the image target like Figure 4.3 below.

## 3D MAP
The 3D map is just like a floor plan that you see in shopping malls but it is 3D. You can use it to identify or explore locations. You can request navigations to a specific location.

### YOUR LOCATION

<img src="images/demo_location_marker.png" alt="Location Marker" width="450" height="300"/>

The Location Marker shown in above indicates your position in the map. The Location Marker is static and will not move because the image targets are designed to be only in a specific location. It will consistently rotate from the start of the application.

### NAVIGATING YOURSELF TO A LOCATION

Each room has a transparent blue door. Aim the camera towards the door and click the door like you are shooting rays from your fingers. The door will turn green and a set of light blue chevrons will line up from the Location Marker to the targeted room.

### CHANGING LEVELS

<img src="images/demo_level_button.png" alt="Level Button" width="350" height="300"/>

At the centre of the 3D map, you will find a blue coloured arrow pointing downwards. This arrow is the level button. The level button sends you a floor up. If you reach the top floor and press it again , it will send you to the ground floor. When you select it the arrow will shake and turn green until the next floor is loaded.
